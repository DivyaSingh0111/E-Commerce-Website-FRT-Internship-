Problem Statement/Opportunity :This project aims to create e-commerce sites for customers to make it easier for them to purchase the products they like from various e-commerce sites on the web. All you need is a PC or laptop and the payment option that is important for shopping online. To access this online shopping service, all customers need an email and password to log in and continue shopping. E-commerce credentials are highly secure and no one can easily crack them. After successfully logging in, customers can purchase various products such as mobile phones, books, clothes, covid-19 supplies, student essentials, gadgets and other things. E-commerce can be used for planning.

Project Description : This project is a purchasing application in an existing store. Make the app easy to use and provide additional features and amenities for students and learning. In order to create an application, full network support must be provided. A complete and efficient web application that can provide online shopping experience is the main goal of this project. This system can be used for any local store or multi-store business with a store. The system offers 24/7 order acceptance and door-to-door delivery to satisfy customers. If stores provide an online website where customers can easily buy from anywhere, they will not lose many customers to popular online stores like Flipkart or on eBay.
